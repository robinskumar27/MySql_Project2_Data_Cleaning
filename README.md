# MySql_Project2_Data_Cleaning

SQL DATA CLEANING

For this project:
Downloaded raw dataset from kaggle 
url is : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022
Raw Dataset name : layoffs.csv
Steps to follow in cleaning the data:
1. check for duplicates and remove any
2. standardize data and fix errors
3. Look at null values and see what 
4. remove any columns and rows that are not necessary - few ways

We duplicated the table for the safety purpose and named as layoffs_staging for safety purpose.
We checked for duplicates rows in dataset by using window function and in order to delete these duplicates we again made a copy of the same table and named as layoffs_staging2.

Followed all the above steps and cleaned the dataset.
